<h1>Execute comorbidity analyses on-line by Comorbidity4web</h1>

Comorbidity4web is a Web Service that enables the execution of comorbidity analyses by means of Comorbidity4j directly from your Web browser. By means of a Web form, users can upload their patient-disease data and configure the different [Comorbidity analysis parameters](ComorbidityAnalysisParametersConfig.md) of Comorbidity4j. Then, by triggering the comorbidity analysis, their data will be uploaded to the Comorbidity4web Service and the comorbidity analysis result will be shown by means of a set of [Web-based interactive visualizations](InteractiveVisualizations.md).  

Comorbidity4web is accessible at: <a href="http://comorbidity.eu/comorbidity4web/" target="_blank">http://comorbidity.eu/comorbidity4web/</a>  

**DISCLAIMER: The patient-disease data that are uploaded to the Comorbidity4web Service will not be stored in the server. Anyway, users can execute comorbidity analyses locally on their PC by downloading Comorbidity4j - see: [Executing Comorbidity4j on your pc](LocalExecution.md)**
