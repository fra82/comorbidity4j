<h1>Comorbidity table</h1>

This table includes the results of a comorbidity analysis carried out by means of Comorbidity4j over a specific patient population.  
  
The comorbidity table is a spreadsheet (TAB-separated, UTF-8) where each row describes the result of the comorbidity analysis of a pair of diseases (diagnoses): disease A and disease B.  
  
Each row includes the following sets of columns:  
  
  
## Disease pair identification columns  
    
For each disease of the pair of diseases, a numeric (columns *disAcodeNum* / *disBcodeNum*) and string (columns *disAcode* / *disBcode*) identifier is provided, together with the extended name (column *disAname* / *disBname*). The string identifier is the one associated to the disease in the Diagnosis data file provided by the user (see: [Patient input file format](InputFileFormat.md)).  
    - *disAcodeNum*  
    - *disAcode*  
    - *disAname*  
    - *disBcodeNum*  
    - *disBcode*  
    - *disBname*  
  
  
## Patient-diseases columns  
    
The following columns describing the number of patients experimenting the diseases A and / or B:  
    - *patTotal*: total number of patients of the comorbidity analysis  
    - *patWdisA*: number of patients with disease A  
    - *patWdisB*: number of patients with disease B  
    - *patWdisAB*: number of patients with disease A and disease B  
    - *patWdisAnotB*: number of patients with disease A and not disease B
    - *patWdisBnotA*: number of patients with disease B and not disease A  
    - *patWOdisAB*: number of patients without disease A and without disease B  
  
  
## Comorbidity scores columns
    
The following columns provide the comorbidity scores associated the the pair of diseases (see [Comorbidity scores](ComorbidityScoresComputed.md)):  
    - *Relative Risk Index*  
    - *Phi Index*  
    - *Odds Ratio Index* (with lower and upper bounds of 95% confidence interval)  
    - *Fisher Test*  
    - *Fisher Test Adjusted* (by the adjustment approach specified by the  [Comorbidity analysis parameters](ComorbidityAnalysisParametersConfig.md))  
    - *Comorbidity Score*  
  
  
## Sex ratio columns  
  
The following columns are useful to characterize the sex ratio:   
    - *femaleWithDisA*: female patients with disease A  
    - *femaleWithDisB*: female patients with disease B  
    - *femaleWithDisAandB*: female patients with disease A and disease B  
    - *maleWithDisA*: male patients with disease A  
    - *maleWithDisB*: male patients with disease B  
    - *maleWithDisAandB*: male patients with disease A and disease B  
    - *sexRatioBA*: a sex-ratio value close to zero indicates that the co-occurrence of the disease B with the disease A is equally likely for males and females. Positive (negative) values of sex ratio indicate that the co-occurrence of the disease B with the disease on the A is more likely for females (males).  
    - *sexRatioAB*: a sex-ratio value close to zero indicates that the co-occurrence of the disease A with the disease B is equally likely for males and females. Positive (negative) values of sex ratio indicate that the co-occurrence of the disease A with the disease on the B is more likely for females (males).
