**Online documentation**: <a href="http://comorbidity4j.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">http://comorbidity4j.readthedocs.io/</a>  
  
  
Comorbidity4j is a java tool tailored to easily perform <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comorbidity" target="_blank">comorbidity analyses</a>, thus **supporting the analysis of significant cooccurrences of diseases over large datasets of patient data**.  

Given the *demographic information* (birth-date, geneder and, optionally secondary patient features like education level, ethnicity, etc.) and the *history of diseases* of a set of patients, Comorbidity4j performs the comorbidity analysis of (a subset of) such diseases: several widespread measures to identify relevant pairs of cooccurring diseases are computed over the patients' population data provided as input.  

Comorbidity analyses can be executed:  

+ **on your PC** by means of Comorbidity4j, a downloadable Java library. The documentation accessible here explains how to download and execute Comorbidity4j.  
+ **online** at <a href="http://comorbidity.eu/comorbidity4web/" target="_blank">http://comorbidity.eu/comorbidity4web/</a> by means of Comorbidity4web, a Web service that enables users to upload patient datasets and generate on-line interactive visualizations of the results of comorbidity analysis.  

If the patient dataset you have to analyze contains sensitive data, you can download the Comorbidity4j Java library and execute the comorbidity analysis locally in your PC.  

To get detailed information on the tool, plese to to: <a href="http://comorbidity4j.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank">http://comorbidity4j.readthedocs.io/</a>.  

Comorbidity4j is distributed as **open source software** - interested users can access the Java source code here on <a href="https://github.com/fra82/comorbidity4j">GitHub / comorbidity4j project</a>. Anyway, the access to the source code is not directly needed to execute Comorbidity4j since we provide the executable version of the tool (as well as the possibility to perform comorbidity analyses online).
